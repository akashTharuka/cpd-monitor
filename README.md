Engineers are required to complete a certain number of CPD (Continuing Professional Development) hours annually. For this purpose, engineers are required to participate in activities that improve/enhance their knowledge and skills. These include seminars, workshops, field visits, etc. Each activity has a defined number of hours and in physical participation, engineers actual hours can be recorded.

With the move to online activities such as webinars, now it is not possible to have a physical record. Also, there are many online meeting/webinar platforms including from Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, Huawei Cloud Meeting, etc. We need a platform independent solution to ensure proper recording of the start of participation in an online event by an engineer, the end of participation, and the continuing presence of the engineer in the online event.

The engineers who participate in CPD hours must be issued with a certificate indicating the details of the CPD activity including the number of hours. These certificates are used to determine the total number of CPD hours earned by an engineer during a period of time (for example, within a given year). This will be used for purposes such as maintaining the status of certain professional affiliations (for example, International Professional Engineer (IPE)).
